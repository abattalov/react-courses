# My Course Review

This is a site where I keep track of all of the disc golf courses I have been to. This is helpful for me to have because there are over 300 courses in Minnesota and remembering every little thing about each course is difficult. This is where this app comes in. I can store information about the course like the name, location, number of holes, and other notable things I want to add in the notes section.

## How to use

First clone down the backend api which can be found here: https://github.com/abattalov/react-courses-backend. Then navigate to the root folder and type in the command 'rails s'. This will start a server on port number 3000.

Then simply clone down this repo, go to the root directory and type in the command 'npm start' to launch the app. This will launch on port 3001.

Once the app is running, you can check out the courses that I have added or add courses of your own if you would like.
